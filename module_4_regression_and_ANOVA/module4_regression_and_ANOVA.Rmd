# lab1, association between triglycerides & BMI???

# graphical displays for triglycerides
boxplot(TG)
stem(TG) # ??? similar to histogram, but in a numeric pattern 
?stem

# creat a binary indicator for BMI > 25 
ibmi <- ifelse(BMI > 25, 1, 0)  # arbitrarily devide BMI into 2 groups

# compute univariate summary statistics for triglycerides for BMI > 25 and BMI <= 25

tapply(TG,ibmi,median)
tapply(TG,ibmi,sd)
# tapply(vector, index, function)

# plot boxplots for triglycerides separately by BMI > 25 and BMI <= 25
boxplot(TG ~ ibmi) # summary boxplot for the 2 groups with different BMI 
t.test(TG ~ ibmi) # doing t-test to see whether there is association 

# instead of t-test, using continous predictor and outcome values to test for association 
# scatterplot of triglycerides vs BMI
plot(BMI, TG)
# fit linear regression models for the association between triglycerdies and BMI
fit1 = lm(TG ~ BMI)
?glm # more generlized, can use glm for lm 
summary(fit1)
confint(fit1) # confidence interval 
fit1$coefficients

# compute the predicted value and its 95% confidence interval for the mean value of TG at BMI=23 as well
# as for a new individual w/ BMI=23. 
predict(fit1, newdata = data.frame(BMI = 23), interval = "confidence") # predicted value and its 95% confidence interval for the mean value of TG at BMI=23
predict(fit1, newdata = data.frame(BMI = 23), interval = "prediction") # predicted value and its 95% confidence interval for a new individual w/ BMI=23

# How do these two intervals differ and why?
# the predicted value for these two are the same but the intervals for predicted value for new individuals are much bigger, because it includes the random variability around the mean.
